Final output for Project: Landing Page  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

## Assignment Instructions:
- **Commit early & often!**  
  Reference the [Commit Message lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-commit-messages) for best practices.

- **Download the design images** and review what you’ll be building:  
  - **Image One:** Full Design  
  - **Image Two:** Color and Fonts

- **Hero text** is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

- There are many ways to approach this project, and starting with a blank HTML document can feel overwhelming.  
  **Suggestion:**  
  - Take it one section at a time.  
  - The website has **4 main sections** (plus a footer).  
  - Pick one section and get it into good shape before moving on.  
  - Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

- For each section:
  1. **Add all the content to the page first** (HTML).
  2. **Then style it** (CSS).
  3. You may need to revisit the HTML after you start styling, but try to avoid bouncing back and forth too much, as it can be time-consuming and frustrating.

- **Note:**  
  - You only need **one CSS file** for this project.

- Many elements on this page are similar to those in the flexbox exercises.  
  Feel free to review those exercises if you need a refresher.

- **Responsiveness is not required.**  
  - You do **not** need to adjust your design for different screen sizes, zoom levels, or mobile devices.  
  - Focus on making it look good on a regular computer screen.  
  - You’ll learn about responsive design later.

- **When you finish, push your work to GitHub!**
